Description: # Seeed DHT
        
        This is a powerful sister version of our Grove - Temperature&Humidity Sensor Pro. It has more complete and accurate performance than the basic version. The detecting range of this sensor is 5% RH - 99% RH, and -40°C - 80°C. And its accuracy reaches up to 2% RH and 0.5°C. A professional choice for applications that have relatively strict requirements.
        
        This code is for
        - [Grove - Temperature&Humidity Sensor Pro](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Temperature%26Humidity-Sensor-Pro%EF%BC%88AM2302%EF%BC%89-p-838.html)
        - [Grove - Temperature & Humidity Sensor (DHT11)](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Temperature-Humidity-Sensor-DHT1-p-745.html)
        - Grove - Temp & Humi Sensor v1.0 (DHT10)
        
        # Dependencies
        This driver depends on:
        - [***grove.py***](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/grove.py)
        
        This is easy to install with the following command.
         ```
        curl -sL https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/grove.py/raw/master/install.sh | sudo bash -s -
         ```
        ## Installing from PyPI
        
        On supported GNU/Linux systems like the Raspberry Pi, you can install the driver locally from PyPI. To install for current user:
        ```
        pip3 install seeed-python-dht
        ```
        To install system-wide (this may be required in some cases):
        ```
        sudo pip3 install seeed-python-dht
        ```
        To install in a virtual environment in your current project:
        ```
        mkdir project-name && cd project-name
        python3 -m venv .env
        source .env/bin/activate
        pip3 install seeed-python-dht
        ```
        
        ## Usage Notes
        
        #### for DHT11,DHT22
        First, Check the corresponding gpio number of the board:
        ```
        pi@raspberrypi:~/Seeed_Python_DHT $ grove_gpio
        Hat Name = 'Grove Base Hat RPi'
        <pin> could be one of below values in the pin column for GPIO function
           And connect the device to corresponding slot
        ==============
         pin | slot
        ==============
          5  | D5   
         12  | PWM  
         16  | D16  
         18  | D18  
         22  | D22  
         24  | D24  
         26  | D26 
        ```
        Next, initialize the sersor object:
        ```python
        import seeed_dht
        # for DHT11 the type is '11', for DHT22 the type is '22'
        sensor = seeed_dht.DHT("11", 12)
        ```
        
        #### for DHT10
        DHT10 uses i2c protocol, So there is no need to specify an extra pin.  
        Just add contents below:
        ```python
        import seeed_dht
        # for DHT11 the type is '11', for DHT22 the type is '22'
        sensor = seeed_dht.DHT("10")
        ```
        
        ## Reading from the Sensor
        To read from the sensor:
        ```
        humi, temp = sensor.read()
        print('DHT{0}, humidity {1:.1f}%, temperature {2:.1f}*'.format(sensor.dht_type, humi, temp))
        ```
